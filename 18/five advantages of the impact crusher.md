## Jaw Crusher With Different Models HXJQ
In actual production,both of them have many differences,as follows: Different hardness of the crushed materials.Jaw crusher processes the hardest and medium hard stones as the first crusher,and impact crusher and cone crusher can both act as secondary crushing devices,but the hardness of the two broken materials is not the same.Impact Crusher Working PrincipleStarting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).

## The Influencing Factors of Impact Crusher Production Capacity
Among the basically used five types of crushers,impact crusher belongs to the machine which crushes brittle material mainly with impact power.There are many factors that can affect the production capasity of the impact crusher and they can be classified into 5 aspects,so here I would describe these 5 factors and propose the corresponding.The rise of mobile impact crushers for recycling.The mobile impact crushing plant,also known as the tracked impact crusher or recycling impactor,is recognizable mainly due to the fact that these crushers are mounted on a tracked undercarriage.Overall range of capacity for mobile impact crushers is roughly about 100 to 500 tons per hour.
