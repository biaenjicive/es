## Application of Orthogonal Experiments in Simulation and.
In this paper,the traveling characteristic value of moving jaw of jaw crusher is studied by optimization experiment.The traveling characteristic value can reflect the relationship between capacity and energy consumption of jaw crusher.When it is around 2.5,the capacity of jaw crusher is high and the energy consumption is low.The virtual prototype model of jaw crusher was established and.Jaw Crusher an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe gyratory crusher can,just like a jaw crusher,accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. As is the case for jaw crushers,there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces,but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.
