## Fly Ash Properties,Types,Mechanism and Uses
If we have Portland cement,and the fly ash is the pozzolana,it can be represented by silica because non crystalline silica glass is the principal constituent of fly ash.The silica combines with the calcium hydroxide released on hydration of Portland cement.Calcium hydroxide in hydrated Portland cement does not do anything for strength,so.Differences Between Portland Cement Concrete and Fly Ash.The aggregates are typically different types of stone,but the base is most often Portland cement,a mixture of clays,metallic elements and minerals like calcium and silica.While Portland cement can have fly ash in it,fly ash concrete is typically made with a base of full fly ash instead of any Portland cement.

## Fly ash Wikipedia
Fly ash or flue ash,also known as pulverised fuel ash in the United Kingdom,is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal fired boilers together with the flue gases.Ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler's combustion chamber (commonly called a firebox) is called bottom ash.The Disadvantages of Fly Ash in Concrete HunkerThe structural effects of fly ash may be more critical,but cosmetic concerns also affect its use in concrete.It is more difficult to control the color of concrete containing fly ash than mixtures with Portland cement only.Fly ash also may cause visual inconsistencies in the finished surface,such as dark streaks from carbon particles.
