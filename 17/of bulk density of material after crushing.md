## Coal preparation plant Wikipedia
The intermediate density material is called middlings.Liberation data is commonly obtained by float and sink analysis.The procedures for this analysis are detailed in Australian Standard AS 4156.1 1994 "Coal preparation — Higher rank coal — Float and sink testing".[citation needed] CrushingEffect of stem crushing on the uniaxial bulk compression.For miscanthus,based on dry bulk density,the mean pressure to reach the target density was 581 kPa and 365 kPa for intact and crushed material,respectively.This represents a 37.2% reduction in pressure to reach the desired bulk density due to crushing.
