## What is direct reduced iron (DRI)? definition and meaning.
direct reduced iron (DRI): Alternative iron source produced by heating an iron ore (generally having 65 to 70 percent iron) at a temperature high enough to burn off its carbon and oxygen content (a process called reduction) but below iron's melting point(1535°C or 2795°F).The output is sold as pellets or briquettes (called hot briquetted iron.WELSPUN STEEL LIMITEDThe process of sponge iron making aims to remove the oxygen from iron ore.The quality of sponge iron is primarily ascertained by the percentage of metallization (removal of oxygen),which is the ratio of metallic iron to the total iron present in the product.Sponge iron manufacture is highly sensitive to raw material characteristics.
