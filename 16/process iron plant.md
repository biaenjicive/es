## How iron is made material,manufacture,making,history.
The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases.In practice,these gases are scrubbed and recycled.Inevitably,however,some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere.A byproduct of iron purification is slag,which is produced in huge amounts.
