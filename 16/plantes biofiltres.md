## Naava and biofiltration natural indoor air for everyone
The good microbes living in plants' roots break the pollutants down into nutrients for the plants.In Naava's biofiltration system,the air circulates through the plants,plants' roots and our growth medium,forming a natural air purification process.The Naava biofiltration process in all its simplicity.My pond biofilter (homestead forum at permies)I put in three water grass plants from a local pond,and wow! In a matter of days the water turned crystal clear.So I am sure that 80% of the filtering happens in the plant roots.This makes a lot of sense,because the main goal of a biofilter is to provide as much surface area as possible,and plant roots provide a lot of surface area.
