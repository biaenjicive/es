## FGD Scrubber Material Material Description User.
FGD scrubber sludge is the wet solid residue generated from the treatment of these emissions.The wet scrubber discharge is an off white slurry with a solids content in the range of 5 to 10 percent.Because FGD systems are usually accompanied by or combined with a fly ash removal system,fly ash is often incorporated into the FGD sludge.Accurate pH Measurement in Limestone ScrubberWet scrubbers are used in utilities,paper mills,and chemical plants to remove sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and other pollutants from gas streams.Undesirable pollutants are removed by contacting the gases with an aqueous solution or slurry containing a sorbent.The most common sorbents are lime,Ca(OH) 2,and limestone,CaCO 3.In limestone gypsum.

A scrubber works by spraying a wet slurry of limestone into a large chamber where the calcium in the limestone reacts with the SO 2 in the flue gas.There are some variations in design of scrubbers.For example,some scrubbers may use other chemicals such as lime or magnesium oxide to react with the SO 2 in the flue gas.Scrubber WikipediaScrubber systems (e.g.chemical scrubbers,gas scrubbers) are a diverse group of air pollution control devices that can be used to remove some particulates and or gases from industrial exhaust streams.The first air scrubber was designed to remove carbon dioxide from the air of an early submarine,the Ictineo I,a role for which they continue to be used today.
