Grinding also increases the total surface area of a given weight of feed,thereby allowing more space for steam condensation during the conditioning process.This results in a higher feed temperature and more water absorption which together,within the time available,increases gelatinization of raw starch.All About Abrasives American MachinistBonded abrasives,such as those in grinding wheels,are made up of grains that are held together by a fixative material.Coated abrasives,such as used in belt,disc,roll,sheet,and flap wheel products,consist of abrasive grains that are built onto a cloth or paper backing.
