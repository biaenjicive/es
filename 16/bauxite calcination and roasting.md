## Calcination Wikipedia
The IUPAC defines calcination as "heating to high temperatures in air or oxygen".However,calcination is also used to mean a thermal treatment process in the absence or limited supply of air or oxygen applied to ores and other solid materials to bring about a thermal decomposition.A calciner is a steel cylinder that rotates inside a heated furnace and performs indirect high temperature.Emissions in alumina calcination OutotecEmissions in alumina calcination; Emissions in alumina calcination.For a producer,being a good "corporate citizen" is important as the public perception and support is often vital to sustaining the operation long term.In that context,emissions are an important factor,not only for the "license to operate" but also in terms of public perception.

## Roasting Pre Treatment of High Sulfur Bauxite for Sulfide.
Dehydration began at 433.0°C,attained its maximum rate at 508.5°C,and ended at 593.0°C.Roasting pre treatment removed approximately 95% of the sulfide,promoted digestion of alumina in bauxite,and reduced the active sulfur content by ~27%.Removal of Potassium and Iron in Low Grade Bauxite by a.In order to explore the commercialized applications of the low grade bauxite in the refractory industry,a calcination integrated with acid leaching method was adopted to remove the potassium (K) and iron (Fe) from the diaspore illite (DI) type low grade bauxite.Following calcining the bauxite at different temperatures,the leaching parameters,including the sulfuric acid concentration.
